# DeskSetupAR

I tried using Vibe Coding, but the AI-generated code was an absolute mess. Debugging it took longer than rewriting it from scratch. Therefore, this project has been deprecated, and I've rebuilt it from the ground up in another project. See details [here](https://github.com/Siriusq/desk-ar/).
